put your project in CONTEXT - give people a reason to care - what was the problem, what's the solution, what tech did you use, optimization/accessibility/etcwhat was the outcome? after deployment = analytics etcHighlight the kind of work you want to be doing.Tell the truth in your own voice.Read it aloud to make sure it sounds like you.Treat it as a draft. Share it early and update it regularly.Where do you see yourself in one to three years?How does your work fit into the world you want to live in?What kinds of projects interest you? (It sometimes helps to list tasks you want to stop doing first.)What kinds of people do you want to work with? Who are your dream clients?What do you want people to do after visiting your website (e.g., hire you, subscribe to your blog)?If someone were telling a potential client about you, what would you want them to say?These notes will guide your writing later in the process.Start with the basics. About pages don’t have to be cutesy or clever. A simple bio with concrete facts goes a long way. Tell us who you are, where you’re from (if it matters to you), where you live, and what you do. And if you have a photo or video of yourself you want to share, make a note to include that.Share your experience. What are you most proud of? This isn’t your CV, so don’t worry about outlining every job you’ve ever had. Summarize your biggest accomplishments, and feel free to link to publications, talks, interviews, events, or recent clients. If you’re a freelancer, you may want to include a short list of skills or services you offer.Show your passion. Don’t be afraid to get personal, especially in your bio. After all, if someone visits this page, they’ve expressed an interest in you as a person. List a few things you love doing, eating, reading, listening to, or thinking about. If you have any special talents or strongly held beliefs, jot those down. How did you get into this field? What do you love about it? Take some time to think about how your process or perspective differs from your peers.Link it up. Don’t forget that you’re writing for the web. Add links to your online shop, newsletter, or side projects.Tell us what to do next. What do you want people to do after meeting you or reading your bio? Point us in the right direction. Maybe you’re taking on illustration projects, looking for blog sponsors, or hoping to do more public speaking. Make it easy to contact you—and if you’re booked up for a while, include a note about your availability or response time.I’m a ______.
I help ______ {make/build} ______.
When I’m not ______, you can find me ______.
Want to work together? I’d love to hear from you.Make it sound like youTry to limit your sentences to one main idea with 20 words or fewer. read it out loudIf this list starts to feel unwieldy, ask yourself: what do you need to share to accomplish your goal? Limit yourself to just that. A quick and easy way to organize your content is to write each item on a sticky note or note card. Make note of the content you already have and the content you need to create. Move your cards around to group your content as it makes sense to you and as it might make sense to someone else visiting your site.

What is the purpose of the project? What problem am I trying to solve? My goal was to create an online profile to promote my design work and gain more exposure. I needed to be able to write articles, display my design work and have people contact me easily. I also wanted it to be unique and memorable, while representing my personality.INITIAL RESEARCH AND IDEA GENERATIONbrainstormingMy skill set is a mix of both coding and design, and I wanted this to be prominent.I’m a big fan of minimalist design and wanted to stick with a mainly black and white palette to allow the design to shine through.I wanted to use my own photo as a hero image to inject some personality into the website.I enjoy the experience of seeing animation as I scroll down a page.I’ve never liked the way in which one Web page jerks to another, so I wanted my transitions to be smooth.I like a generous amount of white space and a full-width layout.Responsiveness is important to me because I want mobile and tablet users to also have an optimal experience.I wanted my case studies to tell a story about my design process, rather than just be a gallery of random images without context.create a timeline NBlogo - design your brandBe concise and friendly in your copy. I like to write in the first person to make it feel more personable. Break your copy into small chunks to improve readability and scannability. I wrote a draft of my content and broke it down into six main parts: home page introduction, a bit about me, places I’ve been featured, my design work, my blog, and my contact details.

Programming is in a lot of ways a creative field, so use your creativity!Make the site interactive, so people want to stay on your site, and they remember it.Buy a domain name -- I moved from aspittel.github.io to alispit.tel. I really like the play on my name, and you can get a lot of domains for pretty cheap. I use NameCheap, and it's totally worth the \$8.00 a year for the domain.Make sure you don't have console errors -- a lot of technical employers look for this, so make sure that your site is bug-free!Don't use a technology just for the sake of it. If you have a super minimalistic personal website, don't use a heavy-duty framework or library just for the sake of using it.Make sure your website works on mobile phones, and I would encourage making it work for users that use a split-screen setup.I would steer away from using a template found online -- to me, it's pretty apparent when these are used. I understand using them for people who aren't web developers, but if you are a web developer show off your skills!Use it to market yourself -- if you want to show off specific skills to employers, make sure those skills are featured on your site. I want people to visit my blog, so I have it featured on my home page. I also want to do more speaking, so I have a whole page dedicated to my talks. I no longer want to write C++ code professionally, so I took those projects off of my site.Make sure your links aren't broken. I have totally been guilty of this at certain points, but it doesn't look great, and then your viewers can't see that destination!Update your portfolio -- I'm guilty of not doing this that often too, but I try at least every few months to add new projects and talks to my site.Use a critical eye, and be intentional about the design. I use Sketch to draft my sites before moving to code.Think about page speed -- I run lighthouse testing on all of my sites to make sure they are performant.
