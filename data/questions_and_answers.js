    question: `How did I get into coding?`,

      `I dedicated a lot of my evenings & weekends to keeping up with developments in ReactJS, completing the Fullstack Open certification (University of Helsinki) & several courses (Udemy, Frontend Masters & Udacity). I also attended JavaScript Meetups, took part in the #100DaysOfCode on Twitter, mentored new CodeClan graduates, & had lots of fun with JAMstack side projects!`,
