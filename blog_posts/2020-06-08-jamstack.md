So in this weird new Covid world, one good thing to emerge has been the launch of free online tech conferences - [Women of React](https://womenofreact.com/) and [Svelte Society Day](https://sveltesociety.dev/), to name just a couple. May 27th/28th saw [Jamstack Conf 2020](https://jamstackconf.com/), with [Phil Hawksworth](https://www.hawksworx.com/) as compere and with Mathias Biilmann, CEO of Netlify giving [the keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9yrrQBBKos).

Jamstack has definitely been gaining in popularity lately - Gatsby.js [announced a Series B funding](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-05-27-announcing-series-b-funding/) of a cool $28 million in May, while GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner launched a new framework [Redwood.js](https://redwoodjs.com/) (built with React, GraphQL & Prisma) in early 2020, and Guillermo Rauch announced [$21 million of funding for Vercel (formerly Zeit)](https://vercel.com/blog/zeit-is-now-vercel) in April.

## Wait a minute... What IS the Jamstack?

As with lots of tech trends, terms often get bandied about without folk necessarily knowing what they mean. Jamstack has undergone a few identity shifts already, particularly as the ecosystem around it is developing so rapidly. The original term - **JAMstack** - was coined by Biilmann (c.2016) with capitalisation pointing to the underlying acronym: **JavaScript, API and Markup**.

But Jamstack Conf in May 2020 saw the community agree upon the lowercase **Jamstack** going forwards, indicating that the term refers to something broader than particular languages or formats (there's no need to use JavaScript, for example! Popular SSG [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) supports HAML and other templating languages, while [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is written in Go).

Instead of a defined stack, Jamstack refers more to a development philosophy, with the common feature being simply: **that no server is required to build the site**.

> “Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.”

Common features of the Jamstack ecosystem include:

- **Static Site Generators (SSGs)** - e.g. Gatsby.js, Next.js, Gridsome, Nuxt.js, Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty
- **Headless CMS** - e.g. Sanity.io, Storyblok, NetlifyCMS, Contenful, Forestry.io, Strapi
- **Hosting Services** - e.g. Netlify, Vercel (formerly Zeit), GitHub Pages

But there's also another element: **3rd-party services and serverless functions** (AWS Lambda Functions or Netlify functions) that can add a dynamic experience to your site.
As [Jason Lengstorf](https://lengstorf.com/) puts it: [Static Assets Don’t Necessarily Mean Static Experiences](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/12/dynamic-async-functionality-jamsstack-websites/)

- e.g. Algolia for search, Disqus for comments, Cloudinary for image and video content, AuthO for login, Snipcart and Shopify for ecommerce, Formspree and Netlify for forms

## Pros (& cons?)

What's so great about Jamstack anyway? Turns out, quite a lot!

- **Good Performance:** pages pre-built & served over CDN; request doesn’t hit a server - no need to wait for HTML to compile
- **Good Security:** surface area for attacks is reduced (no need to worry about database vulnerabilities); server-side logic abstracted away into reusable HTTPS-protected APIs/handled by 3rd party services
- **Cheaper & Easier Scaling:** simply serving a stack of static files. Often free to host
- **Fun Developer Experience:** great community, great docs, great learning materials!
- **Good SEO:** prerendered pages are more 'visible' to Google's search bot

BUT, you might not want to use the Jamstack if:

- your site needs frequent or real-time updates e.g. chat
- you're unwilling to depend upon 3rd-party web-services, as dynamic elements such as login and shopping carts currently rely upon these

## What on earth is serverless?

Serverless isn't the absence of servers! It refers instead to the possibility of outsourcing your server to a **cloud provider**, which handles all the hassle around provisioning, scaling, patching, uptime, security...

## ...how about headless?

A Headless CMS - weird as it sounds - is a **Content Management System** that doesn't include a Graphical User Interface, but which is back-end only. A headless CMS stores data (usually JSON) and exposes it via an API. In other words, it's 'decoupled' from the front-end/presentation layer and can be used with whichever framework and SSG you prefer, and whichever device you're targeting. It could be defined as **'Content as a Service'** (CaaS).

## Best Practices

Jamstack.org identifies the current best practices as:

- **Entire Project on a CDN** - faster than relying on requests to a server
- **Everything Lives in Git** - no reliance on databases, so you can just clone & go!
- **Modern Build Tools** - Babel, PostCSS, Webpack etc.
- **Automated Builds** - you can use webhooks to trigger a build on content change in your CMS
- **Atomic Deploys** - no changes go live until all changed files have been uploaded
- **Instant Cache Invalidation** - ensure your CDN has an instant cache purge to make sure the deployed version is up-to-date!

## A final word...

Hopefully there's been some useful info in amongst all this. There are loads of great resources out there that go into more details (see below), and it's worth keeping an eye on Netlify's [blog](https://www.netlify.com/blog) for news of their latest work on Build Plugins and enabling [Gatsby Incremental Builds](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/23/enable-gatsby-incremental-builds-on-netlify/) for an even-better deployment experience! With Redwood.js as a 'full-stack serverless web application framework' and [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) bringing serverless databases into the mix, it looks like there's even more good stuff ahead for Jamstack fans!

Have fun exploring, folks!
